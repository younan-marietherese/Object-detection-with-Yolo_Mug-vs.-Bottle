# Object Detection with YOLO - Mugs Vs. Bottles
# Secured Top 4 – Zaka AI Certification Program Challenge

This project was developed as part of the **Zaka AI Certification Program**, where we explored object detection using YOLO. It secured a **Top 4 position** in the final challenge among all participants.

# Object Detection with YOLO: Mugs vs. Bottles

This repository showcases a custom object detection project using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, where we trained a model to distinguish between **mugs** and **bottles**.

---

## Objective

The goal of this challenge was to explore the **Data Science Lifecycle** through hands-on object detection using YOLO. We selected two objects — **mugs** and **bottles** — and built a custom YOLO-based model capable of detecting them in real-world images.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Google Images  
- **Collection:** 100 images collected per class (mugs and bottles)
- **Annotation Tool:** [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com)  
- Images were uploaded to Roboflow and annotated manually using bounding boxes.
- The dataset was then exported in YOLO format for training.

---

## Key Features

- Built a YOLOv3 object detection pipeline using OpenCV
- Used pre-trained weights and custom class labels (mugs vs. bottles)
- Applied non-max suppression and confidence thresholding
- Visualized bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores
